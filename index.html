    <p>This is a website telling the truth on the earth's true shape.



        Example 1: If the Earth is round then why don't the people in the southern hemisphere or even parts of the northern hemisphere fall off? Because it is flat and it always has. 
        You may be wondering "Well (insert name here) if it is flat then why are the so many pictures of a round earth and why don't people sail off the edge of the earth if it is flat?"
        The reasoning behind the first one is simple: fish eye lenses are used to warp the earths true shape, and the other is actually leaked in the game "Pac Man" where if you go the 
        to the sides you pop out the other but in order to not leak the data necessery to prove that the earth is flat, they made it so you pop out the opposite side unlike in the real 
        world, where you pop out half-way around the map at the same side then "going in the same direction" really becomes going in the opposite direction. Example 2: If the Earth is 
        round and even assuming gravity exists under the surface, then why don't you or other things roll towards the gravity? The answer, as always is that the earth is flat and that
        in this case gravity itself is fake. The earth, sun, moon, planets, and stars all accelerate upward at 32 m/s which is human terminal velocity. Another reason why it is flat 
        is because if it wasn't things would have to be curved to stay up and not fall and does that need to happen in real life? No! So therefore the earth must be flat Goodbye!
